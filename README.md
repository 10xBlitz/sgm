# Seoul Guide Medical (SGM)

Seoul Guide Medical is Multi-Clinic Consultant-Customer manager that is developed in Flutter. It was a replacement of Asana Projects but this time, more security for accessing other clinics.

## AI Tool use

AI tools are GPT code generations thru the use of agentic chat. Auto-completion is also used with AI.

We are free to use them but when we use them, make sure to review all the generated code. Do not rely too much on AI because it can lead you into trouble.

## Structure

1. Services
    - Must separate the logic into Services so that it can be reused.
2. Screens
    - Pages
3. Widgets
    - Reusable widgets
4. Extensions
    - if the reusable logfic/function is directly related to the Type itself
5. Theme
